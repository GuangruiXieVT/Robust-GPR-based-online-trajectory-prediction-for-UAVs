# Robust-GPR-based-online-trajectory-prediction-for-UAVs

This repository contains the MATLAB code for the numerical experiments in the paper "Efficient and Robust Online Trajectory Prediction for Non-cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles".

"Trajectory_GUCT.m" is the main file to run the GUCT framework.

"Trajectory_KF.m" is the main file to run the KF-based method.

"get_beta_gamma.m" is the function to calculate beta and gamma coefficients in the uniform error bounds for GPR.

"faul_detect.m" is the function to implement the change-point detection method.

"DHMP.m" is the function to implement the training data pruning method.
